Lab 1. Bird's Eye View of Cassandra
-------------------------------------------------


Imagine that we have turned back the clock to the 1990s and you an
application architect. Whenever you were required to select a suitable
database technology for your applications, what kind of database
technology would you choose? I bet 95 percent (or more) of the time you
would select relational databases.

**Relational databases** have been the
most dominating data management solution since the 1970s. At that time,
the application system was usually silo. The users of the application
and their usage patterns were known and under control. The workload that
had to be catered for by the relational database could be determined and
estimated. Apart from the workload consideration, the data model can
also be structured in normalized forms as recommended by the relational
theory. Moreover, relational databases provide many benefits such as
support of transactions, data consistency, and isolation. Relational
databases just fit perfectly for the purposes. Therefore, it is not
difficult to understand why the relational database has been so popular
and why it is the de facto standard for persistent data stores in
application development.

Nonetheless, with the proliferation of the Internet and the numerous web
applications running on it, the control of the users and their usage
patterns (hence the scale), the workload generated, and the flexibility
of the data model were gone. Typical examples of these web applications
were global e-commerce websites, social media sites, video community
websites, and so on. They generated a tremendous amount of data in a
very short period of time. It should also be noted that the data
generated by these applications were not only structured, but also
semi-structured and even unstructured. Since relational databases were
the de facto standard at that time, developers and architects did not
have many alternatives but were forced to tweak them to support these
web applications, even though they knew that relational databases were
suboptimal and had many limitations. It became apparent that a different
kind of enabling technology should be found to break through the
challenges.

We are in an era of information explosion, as a result of the
ever-increasing amount of user-generated data and content on the Web and
mobile applications. The generated data is not only large in volume and
fast in velocity but it is also diversified in variety. Such rapidly
growing data of different varieties is often termed as **Big Data**.

No one has a clear, formal definition of Big Data. People, however,
unanimously agree that the most fundamental characteristics of Big Data
are related to large volume, high velocity, and great variety. Big Data
imposes real, new challenges to the information systems that have
adopted traditional ways of handling data. These systems are not
designed for web-scale and for being enhanced to do so, cost
effectively. Due to this, you might find yourself asking whether or not
we have any alternatives.

Challenges come with opportunities on the flip side. A new breed of data
management products was born. The most recent answer to the question in
the last paragraph is NoSQL.



What is NoSQL?
--------------------------------



The need to tackle the Big Data challenges has led to
the emergence of new data management technologies and techniques. Such
technologies and techniques are rather different from the ubiquitous
relational database technology that has been used for over 40 years.
They are collectively known as **NoSQL**.

NoSQL is an umbrella term for the data stores that are not based on the
relational data model. It encompasses a great variety of many different
database technologies and products. As shown in the following figure,
The **Data Platforms Landscape Map**,
there are over 150 different database products that belong to the
non-relational school as mentioned in
<http://nosql-database.org/>. Cassandra is one of the most popular ones.
Other popular NoSQL database products are, just to name a few, MongoDB,
Riak, Redis, Neo4j, so on and so forth.

So, what kinds of benefits are provided by NoSQL? When compared to the
relational database, NoSQL overcomes the weaknesses that the relational
data model does not address well, which are as
 follows:


-   Huge volume of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data

-   Flexible data model (schema) that is easy to change

-   Scalability and performance for web-scale applications

-   Lower cost

-   Impedance mismatch between the relational data model and
    object-oriented programming

-   Built-in replication

-   Support for agile software
    development

### Note

**Limitations of NoSQL Databases**

Many NoSQL databases do not support transactions.
They use replication extensively so that the data in the cluster might
be momentarily inconsistent (although it is eventually consistent). In
addition, the range queries are not available in NoSQL databases.
Furthermore, a flexible schema might lead to problems with efficient
searches.

The huge volume of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data
was mentioned earlier. What I want to dive deeper into here is that
different NoSQL databases provide different solutions for each of them.
The primary factor to be considered is the NoSQL database type, which
will be introduced in the subsequent section.

All NoSQL databases provide a flexible data model
that is easy to change and some might be even schemaless. In a
relational database, the relational data model is called schema. You
need to understand the data to be stored in a relational database,
design the data model according to the relational database theory, and
define the schema upfront in the relational database before you can
actually store data inside it. It is a very structured approach for
structured data. It is a prescriptive data modeling process. It is
absolutely fine if the data model is stable, because there are not many
changes required. But what if the data model keeps changing in the
future and you do not know what needs to be changed? You cannot
prescribe comprehensively in advance. It leads to many inevitable
remedies; say, data patching for example, to change the schema.

Conversely, in NoSQL databases, you need not prescribe comprehensively.
You only need to describe what is to be stored. You are not bound by the
relational database theory. You are allowed to change the data model
whenever necessary. The data model is schemaless and is a living object.
It evolves as life goes on. It is a descriptive data modeling process.

Scalability and performance for web-scale applications refer to the
ability of the system to be scaled, preferably horizontally, to support
web-scale workloads without considerably deteriorating system
performance. Relational databases can only be scaled out to form a
cluster consisting of a very small number of nodes. It implies the
rather low ceiling imposed on these web-scale applications using
relational databases. In addition, changing the schema in a clustered
relational database is a big task of high complexity. The processing
power required to do this is so significant that the system performance
cannot be unaffected. Most NoSQL databases were created to serve
web-scale applications. They natively support horizontal scaling without
very little degrade on the performance.

Now let us talk about money. Traditionally, most
high-end relational databases are commercial products that demand their
users to pay huge software license fees. Besides, to run these high-end
relational databases, the underlying hardware servers are usually
high-end as well. The result is that the hardware and software costs of
running a powerful relational database are exceptionally large. In
contrast, NoSQL databases are open source and community-driven in a
majority, meaning that you need to pay the software license cost, which
is an order of magnitude less than other databases. NoSQL databases are
able to run on commodity machines that will lead to a possible churn, or
crashes. Therefore, the machines are usually configured to be a cluster.
High-end hardware servers are not needed and so the hardware cost is
tremendously reduced. It should be noted that when NoSQL databases are
put into production, some cost of the support is still required but it
is definitely much less when compared to that of commercial products.

There exists a generation gap between the relational data model and
object-oriented programming. The relational data model was the product
of 1970s, whereas object-oriented programming became very popular in
1990s. The root cause, known as impedance mismatch, is an inherent
difficulty of representing a record or a table in a relational data
model with the object-oriented model. Although there are resolutions for
this difficulty, most application developers still feel very frustrated
to bring the two together.


### Note

**Impedance Mismatch**

Impedance mismatch is the difference between the
relational model and the in-memory data structures that are usually
encountered in object-oriented programming languages.

Built-in replication is a feature that most NoSQL databases provide to
support high availability in a cluster of many nodes. It is usually
automatic and transparent to the application developers. Such a feature
is also available in relational databases, but the database
administrators must struggle to configure, manage, and operate it by
themselves.

Finally, relational databases do not support agile software development
very well. Agile software development is iterative by nature. The
software architecture and data model emerge and evolve as the project
proceeds in order to deliver the product incrementally. Hence, it is
conceivable that the need of changing the data model to meet the new
requirements is inevitably frequent. Relational databases are structured
and do not like changes. NoSQL can provide such flexibility for agile
software development teams by virtue of its schemaless characteristic.
Even better, NoSQL databases usually allow the changes to be implemented
in real time without any downtime.



### NoSQL Database types


Now you know the benefits of NoSQL databases, but
the products that fall under the NoSQL databases umbrella are quite
varied. How can you select the right one for yourself among so many
NoSQL databases? The selection criteria of which NoSQL database fits
your needs is really dependent on the use cases at hand. The most
important factor to consider here is the NoSQL database type, which can
be subdivided into four main categories:


-   Key/value pair store

-   Column-family store

-   Document-based repository

-   Graph database
:::

The NoSQL database type dictates the data model that you can use. It is
beneficial to understand each of them deeper.



#### Key/value pair store


Key/value pair is the simplest NoSQL database type.
Key/value store is similar to the concept of Windows registry, or in
Java or C\#, a map, a hash, a key/value pair. Each
data item is represented as an attribute name, also a key, together with
its value. It is also the basic unit stored in the database. Examples of
the NoSQL databases of key/value pair type
are **Amazon Dynamo**, **Berkeley
DB**, **Voldemort** and
**Riak**.

Internally, key/value pairs are stored in a data structure called **hashmap**. Hashmap is popular because it
provides very good performance on accessing data. The key of a key/value
pair is unique and can be searched very quickly.

Key/value pair can be stored and distributed in the disk storage as well
as in memory. When used in memory, it can be used as a cache, which
depends on the caching algorithm, can considerably reduce disk I/O and
hence boost up the performance significantly.

On the flip side, key/value pair has some drawbacks, such as lack of
support of range queries, no way to operate on multiple keys
simultaneously, and possible issues with load balancing.


#### Column-family store


A column in this context is not equal to a column in
a relational table. In the NoSQL world, a column is a data structure
that contains a key, value, and timestamp. Thus, it can be regarded as a
combination of key/value pair and a timestamp.
Examples are **Google BigTable**,
**Apache Cassandra**, and  **Apache
HBase**. They provide optimized performance for queries over
very large datasets.

Column-family store is basically a multi-dimensional
map. It stores columns of data together as a row, which is associated
with a row key. This contrasts with rows of data in a relational
database. Column-family store does not need to store null columns, as in
the case of a relational database and so it consumes much less disk
space. Moreover, columns are not bound by a rigid schema and you are not
required to define the schema upfront.

The key component of a column is usually called the primary key or the
row key. Columns are stored in a sorted manner by the row key. All the
data belonging to a row key is stored together. As such, read and write
operations of the data can be confined to a local node, avoiding
unnecessary inter-node network traffic in a cluster. This mechanism
makes the data lookup and retrieval extremely efficient.

Obviously, a column-family store is not the best solution for systems
that require ACID transactions and it lacks the support for aggregate
queries provided by relational databases such as `SUM()`.


#### Document-based repository


Document-based repository is designed for documents
or semi-structured data. The basic unit of a
document-based repository associates each key, a primary identifier,
with a complex data structure called a document. A document can contain
many different key-value pairs, or key-array pairs, or even nested
documents. Therefore, document-based repository does not adhere to a
schema. Examples are **MongoDB** and
 **CouchDB**.

In practice, a document is usually a loosely structured set of key/value
pairs in the form of  **JavaScript Object
Notation** (**JSON**). Document-based repository
manages a document as a whole and avoids breaking up a document into
fragments of key/value pairs. It also allows document properties to be
associated with a document.

As a document does not
adhere to a fixed schema, the search performance is not guaranteed.
There are generally two approaches to query a document database. The
first is to use materialized views (such as CouchDB) that are prepared
in advance. The second is to use indexes defined on the document values
(such as MongoDB) that behave in the same way as a relational database
index.


#### Graph database


Graph databases are designed for storing information
about networks, such as a social network. A graph is
used to represent the highly connected network that is composed of nodes
and their relationships. The nodes and relationships can have individual
properties. The prominent graph databases include
**Neo4J** and  **FlockDB**.

Owing to the unique characteristics of a graph, graph databases commonly
provide APIs for rapid traversal of graphs.

Graph databases are particularly difficult to be scaled out with
sharding because traversing a graph of the nodes on different machine
does not provide a very good performance. It is also not a
straightforward operation to update all or a subset of the nodes at the
same time.

So far, you have grasped the fundamentals of the NoSQL family. Since
this course concentrates on Apache Cassandra and its data model, you need
to know what Cassandra is and have a basic understanding of what its
architecture is, so that you can select and leverage the best available
options when you are designing your NoSQL data model and application.


What is Cassandra?
------------------------------------



**Cassandra** can be simply described in
a single phrase: a massively scalable, highly available open source
NoSQL database that is based on peer-to-peer architecture.

Cassandra is now 5 years old. It is an active open source project in the
Apache Software Foundation and therefore it is known as Apache Cassandra
as well. Cassandra can manage huge volume of structured,
semi-structured, and unstructured data in a large distributed cluster
across multiple data centers. It provides linear scalability, high
performance, fault tolerance, and supports a very flexible data model.


### Note

**Netflix and Cassandra**

One very famous case study of Cassandra is
Netflix's move to replace their Oracle SQL database to Cassandra
running on cloud. As of March 2013, Netflix's Cassandra deployment
consists of 50 clusters with over 750 nodes. For more information,
please visit the case study at
<http://www.datastax.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/CS-Netflix.pdf>.

In fact, many of the benefits that Cassandra provides are inherited from
its two best-of-breed NoSQL parents, Google BigTable and Amazon Dynamo.
Before we go into the details of Cassandra's architecture, let us walk
through each of them first.



### Google BigTable


Google BigTable is Google's core technology,
particularly addressing data persistence and management on web-scale. It
runs the data stores for many Google applications, such as Gmail,
YouTube, and Google Analytics. It was designed to be a web-scale data
store without sacrificing real-time responses. It has superb read and
write performance, linear scalability, and continuous availability.

Google BigTable is a sparse, distributed, persistent, multidimensional
sorted map. The map is indexed by a row key.

Despite the many benefits Google BigTable provides, the underlying
design concept is really simple and elegant. It uses a persistent
commitlog for every data write request that it receives and then writes
the data into a memory store (acting as a cache). At regular intervals
or when triggered by a particular event, the memory store is flushed to
persistent disk storage by a background process. This persistent disk
storage is called **Sorted String Table**, or
**SSTable**. The SSTable is immutable
meaning that once it has been written to a disk, it will never be
changed again. The word *sorted* means that the data inside
the SSTable is indexed and sorted and hence the data can be found very
quickly. Since the write operation is log-based and memory-based, it
does not involve any read operation, and therefore the write operation
can be extremely fast. If a failure happens, the commitlog can be used
to replay the sequence of the write operations to merge the data that
persists in the SSTables.

Read operation is also very efficient by looking up the data in the
memory store and the indexed SSTables, which are then merged to return
the data.

All the above-mentioned Google BigTable brilliances
do come with a price. Because Google BigTable is distributed in nature,
it is constrained by the famous *CAP theorem*, stating the
relationship among the three characteristics of a distributed system,
namely Consistency, Availability, and Partition-tolerance. In a
nutshell, Google BigTable prefers Consistency and Partition-tolerance to
Availability.


### Note

**The CAP theorem**

CAP is an acronym of the  three characteristics of a
distributed system: Consistency, Availability, and Partition-tolerance.
Consistency means that all the nodes in a cluster see the same data at
any point in time. Availability means that every request that is
received by a non-failing node in the cluster must result in a response.
Partition-tolerance means that a node can still function when
communication with other groups of nodes is lost. Originating from Eric
A. Brewer, the theorem states that in a distributed system, only two out
of the three characteristics can be attained at the most.

Google BigTable has trouble with Availability while keeping Consistency
across partitioned nodes when failures happen in the cluster.


### Amazon Dynamo


Amazon Dynamo is a proprietary key-value store
developed by Amazon. It is designed for high performance, high
availability, and continuous growth of data of huge volume. It is the
distributed, highly available, fault-tolerant skeleton for Amazon.
Dynamo is a peer-to-peer design meaning that each node is a peer and no
one is a master who manages the data.

Dynamo uses data replication and auto-sharding across multiple nodes of
the cluster. Imagine that a Dynamo cluster consists of many nodes. Every
write operation in a node is replicated to two other nodes. Thus, there
are three copies of data inside the cluster. If one of the nodes fails
for whatever reason, there are still two copies of data that can be
retrieved. Auto-sharding ensures that the data is partitioned across the
cluster.


### Note

**Auto-sharding**

NoSQL database products usually support auto-sharding so that they can natively and automatically
distribute data across the database cluster. Data and workload are
automatically balanced across the nodes in the cluster. When a node
fails for whatever reason, the failed node can be quickly and
transparently replaced without service interruptions.

Dynamo focuses primarily on the high availability of
a cluster and the most important idea is eventual consistency. While
considering the CAP Theorem, Dynamo prefers Partition-tolerance and
Availability to Consistency. Dynamo introduces a mechanism called
**Eventual Consistency** to support
consistency. Temporary inconsistency might occur in the cluster at a
point in time, but eventually all the nodes will receive the latest
consistent updates. Given a sufficiently long period of time without
further changes, all the updates can be expected to propagate throughout
the cluster and the replicas on all the nodes will be consistent
eventually. In real life, an update takes only a fraction of a second to
become eventually consistent. In other words, it is a trade-off between
consistency and latency.


### Note

**Eventual consistency**

Eventual consistency is not inconsistency. It is a weaker form of
consistency than the typical Atomic-Consistency-Isolation-Durability
(ACID) type consistency is found in the relational
databases. It implies that there can be short intervals of inconsistency
among the replicated nodes during which the data gets updated among
these nodes. In other words, the replicas are updated asynchronously.



Cassandra's high-level architecture
------------------------------------------------------



Cassandra runs on a peer-to-peer architecture which
means that all nodes in the cluster have equal responsibilities except
that some of them are seed nodes for other non-seed nodes to obtain
information about the cluster during startup. Each node holds a
partition of the database. Cassandra provides automatic data
distribution and replication across all nodes in the cluster. Parameters
are provided to customize the distribution and replication behaviors.
Once configured, these operations are processed in the background and
are fully transparent to the application developers.

Cassandra is a column-family store and provides great schemaless
flexibility to application developers. It is designed to manage huge
volume of data in a large cluster without a single point of failure. As
multiple copies of the same data (replicas) are replicated in the
cluster, whenever one node fails for whatever reason, the other replicas
are still available. Replication can be configured to meet the different
physical cluster settings, including data center and rack locations.

Any node in the cluster can accept read or write requests from a client.
The node that is connected to a client with a request serves as the
coordinator of that particular request. The coordinator determines which
nodes are responsible for holding the data for the request and acts as a
proxy between the client and the nodes.

Cassandra borrows the commitlog mechanism from Google BigTable to ensure
data durability. Whenever a write data request is received by a node, it
is written into the commitlog. The data that is being updated is then
written to a memory structure, known as memtable. When the memtable is
full, the data inside the memtable is flushed to a disk storage
structure, SSTable. The writes are automatically partitioned by the row
key and replicated to the other nodes holding the same partition.

Cassandra provides linear scalability, which means that the performance
and capacity of the cluster is proportional to the number of nodes in
it.



### Partitioning


The ability to scale horizontally and incrementally
is a Cassandra key design feature. To achieve this, Cassandra is required to dynamically partition
the data over the set of nodes in the cluster.

A cluster is the outermost structure which is
composed of nodes in Cassandra. It is also a container of keyspace. A
keyspace in Cassandra is analogous to a schema in a
relational database. Each Cassandra cluster has a system keyspace to
keep system-wide metadata. It contains the replication settings which
controls how the data is distributed and replicated in a cluster.
Typically, one keyspace is assigned to one cluster but one cluster might
contain more than one keyspace.

The smallest cluster in the theory contains a single node and a cluster
of three or more nodes, which is much more practical. Each node holds a
replica for the different range of data in partitions, and exchanges
information across the cluster every second.

A client issues read or write requests to any node. The node that
receives the request becomes a coordinator that acts as a proxy of the
client to do the things as explained previously. Data is distributed
across the cluster and the node addressing mechanism is called
consistent hashing. Therefore, a cluster can be viewed as a ring of hash
as each node in the cluster or the ring is assigned a single unique
token so that each node is responsible for the data in the range from
its assigned token to that of the previous node. For example, in the
following figure, a cluster contains four nodes with unique tokens:


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fenago/apache-cassandra-intellij/master/md_files/images/8884OS_01_02.jpg)

:::
Cassandra's consistent hashing
:::

Before Version 1.2, tokens were calculated and
assigned manually and from Version 1.2 onwards,
tokens can be generated automatically. Each row has a row key used by a
partitioner to calculate its hash value. The hash
value determines the node which stores the first replica of the row. The
partitioner is just a hash function that is used for calculating a row
key's hash value and it also affects how the data is distributed or
balanced in the cluster. When a write occurs, the first replica of the
row is always placed in the node with the key range of the token. For
example, the hash value of a row key `ORACLE` is
`6DE7` that falls in the range of 4,000 and 8,000 and so the
row goes to the bottom node first. All the remaining replicas are
distributed based on the replication strategy.


### Note

**Consistent hashing**

Consistent hashing allows each node in the cluster
to independently determine which nodes are replicas for a given row key.
It just involves hashing the row key, and then compares that hash value
to the token of each node in the cluster. If the hash value falls in
between a node's token, and the token of the previous node in the ring
(tokens are assigned to nodes in a clockwise direction), that node is
the replica for that row.


### Replication


Cassandra uses replication to attain high availability and data durability. Each data is replicated at
a number of nodes that are configured by a parameter called replication
factor. The coordinator commands the replication of the data within its
range. It replicates the data to the other nodes in the ring. Cassandra
provides the client with various configurable options to see how the
data is to be replicated, which is called replication strategy.

Replication strategy is the method of determining which nodes the
replicas are placed in. It provides many options, such as rack-aware,
rack-unaware, network-topology-aware, so on and so forth.


### Snitch


A snitch determines which data centers and racks to
go for in order to make Cassandra aware of the
network topology for routing the  requests
efficiently. It affects how the replicas can be distributed while
considering the physical setting of the data centers and racks. The node
location can be determined by the rack and data center with reference to
the node's IP address. An example of a cluster across two data centers
is shown in the following figure, in order to illustrate the
relationship among replication factor, replication strategy, and snitch
in a better way:


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fenago/apache-cassandra-intellij/master/md_files/images/8884OS_01_03.jpg)

:::
Multiple data center cluster
:::

Each data center has two racks and each rack contains two nodes
respectively. The replication factor per data center is set to three
here. With two data centers, there are six replicas in total. The node
location that addresses the data center and rack locations are subject
to the convention of IP address assignment of the nodes.


### Seed node


Some nodes in a Cassandra cluster are designated as seed nodes for the others. They are
configured to be the first nodes to start in the cluster. They also
facilitate the bootstrapping process for the new nodes joining the
cluster. When a new node comes online, it will talk to the seed node to
obtain information about the other nodes in the cluster. The talking
mechanism is called  **gossip**. If a
cluster is across multiple data centers, the best practice is to have
more than one seed node per data center.


### Gossip and Failure detection


Nodes need to communicate periodically (every
second) to exchange state information (for example,
dead or alive), about themselves and about other nodes they know about.
Cassandra uses a gossip communication protocol to disseminate the state
information, which is  also known as epidemic protocol. It is a peer-to-peer communication
protocol that provides a decentralized, periodic,
and an automatic way for the nodes in the cluster to exchange the state
information about themselves, and about other nodes they know about with
up to three other nodes. Therefore, all nodes can quickly learn about
all the other nodes in the cluster. Gossip information is also persisted
locally by each node to allow fast restart.

Cassandra uses a very efficient algorithm, called *Phi Accrual Failure
Detection Algorithm*, to detect the
failure of a node. The idea of the algorithm is that the failure
detection is not represented by a Boolean value stating whether a node
is up or down. Instead, the algorithm outputs a value on the continuous
suspicion level between dead and alive, on how confident it is that the
node has failed. In a distributed environment, false negatives might
happen due to the network performance, fluctuating workload, and other
conditions. The algorithm takes all these factors into account and
provides a probabilistic value. If a node has failed, the other nodes
periodically try to gossip with it to see if it comes back online. A
node can then determine locally from the gossip state and its history
and adjust routes accordingly.


### Write path


The following figure depicts the  components and
their sequence of executions that form a write path:


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fenago/apache-cassandra-intellij/master/md_files/images/8884OS_01_04.jpg)

:::
Cassandra write path
:::

When a write occurs, the data will be immediately appended to the
commitlog on the disk to ensure write durability. Then Cassandra stores
the data in memtable, an in-memory store of hot and fresh data. When
memtable is full, the memtable data will be flushed to a disk file,
called SSTable, using sequential I/O and so random I/O is avoided. This
is the reason why the write performance is so high. The commitlog is
purged after the flush.

Due to the intentional adoption of sequential I/O, a row is typically
stored across many SSTable files. Apart from its data, SSTable also has
a primary index and a *bloom filter*. A primary index is a
list of row keys and the start position of rows in the data file.


### Note

**Bloom filter**

Bloom filter is a sample subset of the primary index
with very fast nondeterministic algorithms to check whether an element
is a member of a set. It is used to boost the performance.

For write operations, Cassandra supports tunable
consistency by various write consistency levels. The write consistency
level is the number of replicas that acknowledge a successful write. It
is tunable on a spectrum of write consistency levels, as shown in the
following figure:


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fenago/apache-cassandra-intellij/master/md_files/images/8884OS_01_05.jpg)

:::
Cassandra write consistency levels
:::

The following describes the terms in the figure:


-   **ANY**: This is the lowest
    consistency (but highest availability)

-   **ALL**: This is  the highest
    consistency (but lowest availability)

-   **ONE**: This gives at least one
    replica

-   **TWO**: This gives at least two
    replicas

-   **THREE**: This gives at least three
    replicas

-   **QUORUM**: This ensures strong
    consistency by tolerating some level of failure, which is determined
    by *(replication\_factor / 2) + 1* (rounded down to the
    nearest integer)

-   **LOCAL\_QUORUM**: This is  for
    multi-data center and rack-aware without inter-data center traffic

-   **EACH\_QUORUM**: This is for
    multi-data center and rack-aware
:::

The two extremes are the leftmost **ANY**
which means weak consistency and the rightmost **ALL** means
strong consistency. A consistency level of
**THREE** is very common in practice. **QUORUM**
can be chosen to be an optimum value, as calculated by the given
formula. Here, the replication factor is the number of replicas of data
on multiple nodes. Both **LOCAL QUORUM** and **EACH
QUORUM** support multiple data centers and rack-aware write
consistency with a slight difference as shown earlier.


### Read path


On the flip side, the following figure shows the
components and their sequence of executions that
form a read path:


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fenago/apache-cassandra-intellij/master/md_files/images/8884OS_01_06.jpg)

:::
Cassandra read path
:::

When a read request comes in to a node, the data to
be returned is merged from all the related SSTables and any unflushed
memtables. Timestamps are used to determine which one is up-to-date. The
merged value is also stored in a write-through row cache to improve the
future read performance.

Similar to the write consistency levels, Cassandra also provides tunable
read consistency levels, as shown in the following figure:

:::
Cassandra read consistency levels
:::

The following describes the terms in the figure:


-   **ALL**: This is  the highest
    consistency (but lowest availability)

-   **ONE**: This gives at least one
    replica

-   **TWO**: This gives at least two
    replicas

-   **THREE**: This  gives at least three
    replicas

-   **QUORUM**: This ensures strong
    consistency by tolerating some level of failure, which is determined
    by *(replication\_factor / 2) + 1* (rounded down to the
    nearest integer)

-   **LOCAL\_QUORUM**: This is  for
    multi-data center and rack-aware without inter-data center traffic

-   **EACH\_QUORUM**: This is for
    multi-data center and rack-aware
:::

Read consistency level is the number of replicas contacted for a
successful, consistent read, almost identical to write consistency
levels, except that **ANY** is not an option here.


### Repair mechanism


There are three built-in repair mechanisms provided
by Cassandra:


-   Read repair

-   Hinted handoff

-   Anti-entropy node repair
:::

During a read, the coordinator that is just the node connects and
services the client, contacts a number of nodes as specified by the
consistency level for data and the fastest replicas will return the data
for a consistency check by in-memory comparison. As it is not a
dedicated node, Cassandra lacks a single point of failure. It also
checks all the remaining replicas in the background. If a replica is
found to be inconsistent, the coordinator will issue an update to bring
back the consistency. This mechanism is called 
**read repair**.

**Hinted handoff** aims at reducing the
time to restore a failed node when rejoining the cluster. It ensures
absolute write availability by sacrificing a bit of
read consistency. If a replica is down at the time a write occurs,
another healthy replica stores a hint. Even worse, if all the relevant
replicas are down, the coordinator stores the hint locally. The hint
basically contains the location of the failed replica, the affected row
key, and the actual data that is being written. When a node responsible
for the token range is up again, the hint will be handed off to resume
the write. As such, the update cannot be read before a complete handoff,
leading to inconsistent reads.

Another repair mechanism is called 
**anti-entropy** which is a replica synchronization mechanism
to ensure up-to-date data on all nodes and is run by the administrators
manually.



Features of Cassandra
---------------------------------------



In order to keep this lab short, the following
bullet list covers the great features provided by Cassandra:


-   Written in Java and hence providing native Java support

-   Blend of Google BigTable and Amazon Dynamo

-   Flexible schemaless column-family data model

-   Support for structured and unstructured data

-   Decentralized, distributed peer-to-peer architecture

-   Multi-data center and rack-aware data replication

-   Location transparent

-   Cloud enabled

-   Fault-tolerant with no single point of failure

-   An automatic and transparent failover

-   Elastic, massively, and linearly scalable

-   Online node addition or removal

-   High Performance

-   Built-in data compression

-   Built-in caching layer

-   Write-optimized

-   Tunable consistency providing choices from very strong consistency
    to different levels of eventual consistency

-   Provision of **Cassandra Query Language**
    (**CQL**), a SQL-like language
    imitating `INSERT` , `UPDATE` ,
    `DELETE` , `SELECT` syntax of SQL

-   Open source and community-driven



Summary
-------------------------



In this lab, we have gone through a bit of history starting from the
1970s. We were in total control of the data models that were rather
stable and the applications that were pretty simple. The relational
databases were a perfect fit in the old days. With the emergence of
object-oriented programming and the explosion of the web applications on
the pervasive Internet, the nature of the data has been extended from
structured to semi-structured and unstructured. Also, the application
has become more complex. The relational databases could not be perfect
again. The concept of Big Data was created to describe such challenges
and NoSQL databases provide an alternative resolution to the relational
databases.

NoSQL databases are of a wide variety. They provide some common benefits
and can be classified by the NoSQL database type. Apache Cassandra is
one of the NoSQL databases that is a blend of Google BigTable and Amazon
Dynamo. The elegance of its architecture inherits from the DNA of these
two parents.

In the next lab, we will look at the flexible data model supported
by Cassandra.
